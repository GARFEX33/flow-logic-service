# Task ID: 12
# Title: Orchestration Error Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a centralized error handling mechanism within the orchestration flow. This includes capturing errors during handler execution, logging the error details, and marking the corresponding `flujo_ejecutado` record as `fallido`.
# Details:
Modify the orchestration logic (to be implemented in Task 13) to include try-catch blocks around handler execution. In case of an error, log the error using the configured logger (Task 3) and use the Flow State Manager (Task 9) to update the flow state to `fallido`, including the error details. Use Context7 MCP annotations for error handling points.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests that simulate handler errors and verify that the error is logged correctly and the flow state is updated to `fallido` with error details using the mock Flow State Manager and Logger.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Try-Catch Blocks Around Handler Execution [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the orchestration logic to include try-catch blocks around each handler execution to capture potential errors during their execution.
### Details:
Incorporate try-catch blocks around each handler execution within the orchestration flow to capture and handle any exceptions that may occur during their execution. This ensures that errors are caught and can be managed appropriately, preventing the orchestration from failing unexpectedly. For more information on implementing try-catch blocks in Java, refer to the Java Tutorials on Exceptions. ([docs.oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/catch.html?utm_source=openai))

## 2. Log Error Details Using Configured Logger [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Configure the orchestration to log error details using the existing logger whenever an exception is caught during handler execution.
### Details:
Ensure that the orchestration is configured to log detailed information about any exceptions caught during handler execution. This includes the exception message, stack trace, and any relevant context information. Utilizing the existing logger (as configured in Task 3) will maintain consistency in logging practices across the application. For guidance on logging exceptions in Java, refer to the Java Tutorials on Exceptions. ([docs.oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/catch.html?utm_source=openai))

## 3. Update Flow State to 'fallido' Using Flow State Manager [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Modify the orchestration to update the flow state to 'fallido' using the Flow State Manager whenever an exception is caught during handler execution.
### Details:
After catching an exception and logging the error details, utilize the Flow State Manager (as implemented in Task 9) to update the corresponding `flujo_ejecutado` record's state to 'fallido'. This ensures that the orchestration accurately reflects the failure state and can trigger appropriate failure handling mechanisms. For more information on managing flow states, refer to the Flow State Manager documentation.
