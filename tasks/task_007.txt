# Task ID: 7
# Title: Kafka Consumer Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Kafka consumer setup using kafkaJS. This includes connecting to the broker URL, subscribing to configured topics, and setting up the message processing loop.
# Details:
Install kafkaJS. Create a Kafka consumer instance configured with the BROKER_URL. Implement connection and disconnection logic. Set up subscription to topics (initially, this might be a placeholder topic or configured via env var). Implement the `eachMessage` handler skeleton. Place this in infrastructure/messaging/. Use Context7 MCP annotations for Kafka connection and message handling entry point.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests to verify successful connection to a Kafka broker (mock or real test instance) and subscription to topics. Verify that the `eachMessage` handler is invoked upon receiving messages.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure KafkaJS [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up KafkaJS in the project by installing it via npm and configuring the Kafka client with the appropriate broker URL and client ID.
### Details:
Install KafkaJS using npm: `npm install kafkajs`. Configure the Kafka client with the broker URL and client ID as per the project's requirements. ([kafka.js.org](https://kafka.js.org/docs/next/consumer-example?utm_source=openai))

## 2. Implement Kafka Consumer Instance [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a Kafka consumer instance with a specified group ID and set up connection and disconnection logic to handle consumer lifecycle events.
### Details:
Initialize the consumer with a unique group ID. Implement connection logic to connect to the Kafka broker and disconnection logic to gracefully handle consumer shutdowns. ([kafka.js.org](https://kafka.js.org/docs/next/consumer-example?utm_source=openai))

## 3. Subscribe to Topics and Implement Message Processing [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Subscribe the consumer to the desired Kafka topics and implement the `eachMessage` handler to process incoming messages, including logging message details and handling errors appropriately.
### Details:
Use the `eachMessage` handler to process messages, logging details such as topic, partition, offset, and message value. Implement error handling to manage exceptions during message processing. ([kafka.js.org](https://kafka.js.org/docs/next/consumer-example?utm_source=openai))
