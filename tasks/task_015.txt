# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Health Check Endpoint
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a simple HTTP health check endpoint (`/health`) that returns a 200 OK response when the service is running. This is required for readiness probes in containerized environments.
# Details:
Use a lightweight HTTP server library (e.g., http module in Node.js or Express if preferred, though simple http is sufficient). Create an endpoint at `/health` that listens on a configurable port (or a default). This endpoint should simply respond with status 200 and potentially a small body like `{ status: 'ok' }`. Place this in interfaces/http/. Use Context7 MCP annotations for the health check endpoint definition.

# Test Strategy:
Use a tool like curl or a simple script to send an HTTP GET request to the /health endpoint and verify that it returns a 200 OK status code.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Health Check Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a simple HTTP server using Node.js's built-in 'http' module that listens on a configurable port and responds with a 200 OK status and a JSON body containing { status: 'ok' } when the '/health' endpoint is accessed.
### Details:
Utilize Node.js's 'http' module to set up a server that listens on a specified port. Define a route for the '/health' endpoint that responds with a 200 OK status and a JSON object { status: 'ok' } to indicate the service is running. This setup is essential for readiness probes in containerized environments. For more information on creating HTTP servers in Node.js, refer to DigitalOcean's tutorial on creating a web server with the HTTP module.

## 2. Define Health Check Endpoint Using Context7 MCP Annotations [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Use Context7 MCP annotations to define the '/health' endpoint, ensuring it is recognized and properly handled within the system's context.
### Details:
Implement Context7 MCP annotations to define the '/health' endpoint, ensuring it is recognized and properly handled within the system's context. This step is crucial for integrating the health check endpoint into the broader system architecture. Specific implementation details for Context7 MCP annotations can be found in the Context7 MCP documentation. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express.js?utm_source=openai))
