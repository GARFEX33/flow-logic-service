# Task ID: 5
# Title: Event Schema Validation with Zod
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement schema validation for incoming events using Zod, based on the defined Event domain model. This ensures events conform to the expected structure before processing.
# Details:
Install zod. Create Zod schemas corresponding to the Event structure defined in the domain layer. Implement a validation function that takes an event object and returns a validated object or throws a validation error. Place this logic in the domain or application layer. Use Context7 MCP annotations for validation logic.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the validation function, covering valid and invalid event structures, missing fields, and incorrect data types.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Zod and Set Up Event Schema [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the Zod library and define schemas that correspond to the Event domain model to ensure data validation.
### Details:
Use npm to install Zod: `npm install zod`. Then, create Zod schemas that mirror the Event domain model, specifying the expected structure and types for each field.

## 2. Implement Validation Function [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop a function that accepts an event object, validates it using the defined Zod schemas, and returns the validated object or throws an error if validation fails.
### Details:
Create a function that takes an event object as input, parses it using the Zod schemas, and handles validation errors appropriately, either by returning the validated object or throwing a detailed error.

## 3. Integrate Validation Logic with Context7 MCP Annotations [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Incorporate the validation function into the domain or application layer, utilizing Context7 MCP annotations to manage validation logic effectively.
### Details:
Place the validation function within the appropriate layer of the application architecture and use Context7 MCP annotations to annotate the validation logic, facilitating better management and understanding of the validation process.
