# Task ID: 8
# Title: Dynamic Handler Registration Mechanism
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a mechanism for dynamically registering and retrieving handlers for different event types (`tipo_evento`). This could be a simple map or dictionary.
# Details:
Create a registry class or module (e.g., src/application/handlerRegistry.ts). This registry should provide methods to `registerHandler(eventType, handlerFunction)` and `getHandler(eventType)`. Handlers should conform to a defined interface (e.g., `(event: Event) => Promise<void>`). Use Context7 MCP annotations for the registry methods.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the registry to verify that handlers can be registered and retrieved correctly by event type, and that retrieving a non-existent handler returns undefined or null.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Handler Registry Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the interface for the handler registry, specifying methods for registering and retrieving handlers, and ensuring handlers conform to a defined interface.
### Details:
Create a TypeScript interface for the handler registry with methods `registerHandler(eventType: string, handlerFunction: (event: Event) => Promise<void>)` and `getHandler(eventType: string): (event: Event) => Promise<void>`. Ensure that handler functions adhere to the specified signature to maintain consistency and reliability in event handling.

## 2. Implement Handler Registry Class [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop a class that implements the handler registry interface, managing the storage and retrieval of handlers for different event types.
### Details:
Create a TypeScript class that implements the handler registry interface defined in the previous subtask. Utilize a data structure, such as a Map, to store handlers keyed by their event types. Implement the `registerHandler` and `getHandler` methods to manage the addition and retrieval of handlers, respectively.

## 3. Integrate Context7 MCP Annotations [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Incorporate Context7 MCP annotations into the handler registry methods to enhance documentation and maintainability.
### Details:
Utilize Context7 MCP annotations to document the `registerHandler` and `getHandler` methods within the handler registry class. This integration will provide up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples, improving the clarity and maintainability of the codebase. Refer to the Context7 MCP documentation for guidance on proper annotation usage.
