# Task ID: 10
# Title: External Service Integration Stubs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create interfaces and basic stub implementations for interacting with external services like `image-processing-service` and `file-storage-service`. These stubs should represent the communication layer (HTTP/gRPC/messaging) without full business logic.
# Details:
Define interfaces for external service clients in the domain layer (e.g., `IImageProcessingService`, `IFileStorageService`). Create basic stub classes in infrastructure/services/ that implement these interfaces. These stubs can initially just log calls or return dummy data. Use Context7 MCP annotations for external service client interfaces and stub methods.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the stub classes to ensure methods exist and can be called. Verify logging or dummy return values if implemented.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define External Service Client Interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create interfaces for external service clients in the domain layer, such as `IImageProcessingService` and `IFileStorageService`, to represent the communication layer without full business logic.
### Details:
In the domain layer, define interfaces like `IImageProcessingService` and `IFileStorageService` to represent the communication layer for interacting with external services. These interfaces should include method signatures that correspond to the operations provided by the external services, without implementing the full business logic. This approach ensures a clear separation of concerns and facilitates easier testing and maintenance.

## 2. Implement Service Stubs with Context7 MCP Annotations [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create basic stub classes in the `infrastructure/services/` directory that implement the defined interfaces, using Context7 MCP annotations to facilitate integration with external services.
### Details:
In the `infrastructure/services/` directory, implement stub classes that adhere to the interfaces defined in the domain layer. These stub classes should utilize Context7 MCP annotations to facilitate integration with external services. The initial implementation can include logging of method calls or returning dummy data to simulate interactions with the external services. This approach allows for testing and development without the need for actual external service dependencies. ([github.com](https://github.com/mcpconcierge/context7-mcp-server?utm_source=openai))
