# Task ID: 11
# Title: Retry Mechanism Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a RetryManager or similar mechanism to handle transient failures when calling external services or executing specific parts of a handler.
# Details:
Implement a utility or class (e.g., src/infrastructure/utils/retryManager.ts) that can wrap asynchronous operations and retry them a specified number of times with optional delays. Consider using a library like `async-retry`. This manager should be usable by handlers or the orchestrator when calling external services (Task 10). Use Context7 MCP annotations for the retry logic.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the RetryManager to verify that operations are retried correctly on failure and that it eventually fails after the maximum number of retries.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Select a Retry Library [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate and choose an appropriate TypeScript library for implementing retry logic, such as 'async-retry' or 'retryyy'.
### Details:
Evaluate libraries like 'async-retry' ([npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-retry?utm_source=openai)) and 'retryyy' ([github.com](https://github.com/stefanmaric/retryyy?utm_source=openai)) to determine which best fits the project's requirements for handling transient failures in asynchronous operations.

## 2. Implement RetryManager Utility [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop a 'RetryManager' utility that wraps asynchronous operations and retries them a specified number of times with optional delays, utilizing the selected library.
### Details:
Create a utility or class (e.g., 'src/infrastructure/utils/retryManager.ts') that leverages the chosen library to handle retries for asynchronous operations, allowing for configurable retry counts and delays between attempts.

## 3. Integrate RetryManager with Handlers and Orchestrator [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Integrate the 'RetryManager' into existing handlers and the orchestrator to manage retries when calling external services, and apply Context7 MCP annotations for the retry logic.
### Details:
Modify existing handlers and the orchestrator to utilize the 'RetryManager' for retrying operations that interact with external services, ensuring that the retry logic is properly annotated with Context7 MCP annotations to maintain context and traceability.
