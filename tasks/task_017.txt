# Task ID: 17
# Title: Ensure Context7 MCP Annotations Compliance
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review all implemented code to ensure that Context7 MCP annotations are correctly applied according to the specified conventions. This is crucial for maintaining synchronization between specifications and code.
# Details:
Manually review the codebase or use a linter/script if available to check for the presence and correct format of Context7 MCP annotations in relevant code sections (config loading, logging, domain models, validation, database interactions, messaging, handler registry, state management, external service clients, retry logic, error handling, orchestrator, entry point, Dockerfile). Add missing annotations and correct formatting errors.

# Test Strategy:
Perform a code review specifically focused on the presence and correctness of Context7 MCP annotations. If automated tooling exists, run it and fix reported issues.
