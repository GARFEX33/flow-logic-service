# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Base Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Node.js/TypeScript project, set up the basic directory structure following Clean Architecture principles (application, domain, infrastructure, interfaces, config), and configure the build process (tsconfig.json, package.json scripts).
# Details:
Use npm or yarn to initialize the project. Install TypeScript and necessary dev dependencies. Create the src/ directory with subdirectories: application, domain, infrastructure, interfaces, config. Configure tsconfig.json for compilation. Set up basic scripts in package.json for build and start. Ensure the structure supports dependency injection (tsyringe will be used later). Add a basic .gitignore.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure and build process are correctly configured by running build scripts. Check that TypeScript compiles without errors.
